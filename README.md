This is a React Js web-app project and in this project, user can locate his/her location by clicking on the "get coordinates" button, and by doing so a red marker will pop up on the map with showing the user's current location. User can also click on that marker and send their coordinates with their name to the console.

<h2> I have also provided the API key in .env file so that easily you can check the project if it is woking or not
and make sure to turn on your location/ give location permission to this app otherwise it cant find your location and coordinates</h2>
